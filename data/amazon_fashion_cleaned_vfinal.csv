I don't doubt that for a minute - but how would we know it's working anyway? That's pretty much a matter of faith on the part of the consumer.<br /><br />But I do have a problem with the construction of this aluminum wallet: the weak point is definitely the black """"elastic bands"""" on both sides that is designed to hold the wallet tightly closed. The bands do that right now, and they stretch nicely as more cards are inserted into the wallet. But how long are they going to do the job before the stretch out of shape or break- losing their ability to keep the wallet tightly closed (that's all that's keeping your cards in place)?<br /><br />And then there's the rigid clip outside the wallet by which it can be clipped to your belt - not something i want to do in a large crowd. If I'm worried about someone stealing my data with a reader, I'm more worried about someone stealing the whole wallet right off my belt and running away with the actual cards in hand. This is the kind of wallet that should be slipped into a man's side pocket because it's small enough to do that - but with that clip, that's not going to happen.

I've been a bit nostalgic seeing the youth bring them back.<br /> I spent a week reading reviews and searching for the right size, color and price for my next backpack purse. I narrowed it down to two purses. Obviously this was one of them and the other was the LuckyZ red backpack purse. Looking at pictures and reviews and what each bag had to offer I decided to give this one a try. The other was slouchy and the straps looked cheap. The LuckyZ (the other) was more my style when it comes to looks, I like the worn in, vintage style of the bag, but the reviews on this one and the quality (based on the pictures),  had more to offer for a few dollars cheaper. Plus, I planned to start carrying around my sketch pad and drawing tools, the fact that this is water proof was reason enough for me to by it.<br />The only complaint I have (this was mentioned in a few other reviews) are the straps. The buttons on them are useless for an adult my size, 5' 7&#34;, 150 lbs., I had to adjust the straps but without being able to button them they wouldn't stay in place. For the price I made it work, I just adjusted the straps to my liking and hand sewed 5 stitches on each strap to hold the straps in place.

The belt is leather with a synthetic pattern on top of it. The buckle has a single prong that fits into the pre-existing holes. In terms of size it was a good fit, and I have not needed to make any extra holes. It fit easily through the belt loops on my pants, and the belt itself fit nicely through its own belt loop. Sometimes belts especially the wider variety have trouble fitting in some pants. This is not the case with this product.

The elasticity is wonderful because it won’t easily lose shape and still give you the stretch you need if you have a larger head (like mine) but it has the elasticity to fit small heads securely as well.<br /><br />This is a great camping accessory for holding your hair and not allowing the sweat of the day to drip in your face. The width is perfect and is hard to find with most headbands on the market. My pics will show you that this head band is a little wider the half the length of a standard letter sized envelope pictured next to it, along with the knotted feature of this headband. I wear mine with the knot in the back so I can have the extra coverage around the front my hair and my ears. The little gold “Z” emblem does give it a slightly expensive look so I could see me wearing this with a nice knit skirt and pumps on a bad hair day.<br /><br /> I give it 4 stars (subtracting 1) only because the second online picture should show that it is knotted on one side which I would think if worn in the front would take this headband from unisex as advertised to a more feminine look on a man. However, if worn in the back, where mostly hidden, it is not very noticeable and a man could easily get quality wear from this headband.

4,"I like these gloves, but it's a little bit hard to use to use my phone with them. The reason is, even though they fit, they extend past the tip of my finger and thumb. This is because the extra fabric left after it was sewn holds it away from my fingertips. This causes my finger and thumb not to have contact with the touchscreen all of the time (I've had other touchscreen gloves, and this seems to be an issue with those too). If I pull on the glove quite hard and make it tighter, it'll work better, although sometimes not. So far, I've had no problems with them keeping my hands warm, and the temperature has gotten down into the lower 20's, with pretty high winds. I also have a condition that if my hands get chilled, they will react as though they're frost bitten. So far, so good with that characteristic of the gloves. The last important thing is, check the measurements that are given on one of the pictures that are shown at the top their page and do measure your own hands. I normally wear a large and according to those measurements it shows that an extra-large would fit me (if this helps, I wear a medium in medical gloves...or a size 7-1/2 if they're sterile gloves). I went ahead and ordered the extra-large and they fit perfectly.<br />I'm going to try and trim down the ends of the forefinger and thumb where the extra fabric is. I'll update then if that makes a difference.<br />Update: I was not able to trim the end of the fingertips because the way they are sewn makes it impossible to do (the interior of the gloves aren't accessible because of the lining).

It amps up the style factor a bit which is fun.<br />Fit. I ordered a small. I am 5’0 l00lbs and this did not fit me at all. It was way too big.  The shirt itself was way too long as were the sleeves and the chest area just was too baggy. If this were tailored a little bit more to my body, I would have liked it. I wear a size 0, xs - s in most clothing so if you are anywhere near my size, it seems that this brands tends to run a little big. I’d say the small is closer to a US size 2-4. If you have a shorter torso you may find this too long. It just didn't do anything for me and I didn't feel cute in it.<br />Fabrication/Construction. I was impressed with the fabric choice on this. It feels like a true flannel and will definitely keep you warm. The seaming and stitching is high quality and I did not notice any loose threads.<br />Price point.

Don't get me wrong they are comfortable for casual wear, but they offer virtually no support, they just aren't a walking boot. Other than that I have been happy with them.

5,"UPDATE:  I'm attaching some photos of the Vintage F-Series WWII Pilot Design Quartz Chronograph that I just received.  I decided to add a splash of color with a NATO strap, as you can see,  Good looking, unique and interesting fun watch that plays to my interest in vintage historic aviation and military based watch designs.  It will not be to  some folks'  tastes because it IS a fairly sizable watch, and though the big watch fashion has largely left me cold, I do like this one a lot!<br /><br />This is an update to my original disappointed review with 2 Star rating.  After posting that review, the vendor quickly contacted me and offered to send a new watch, free of charge...even though I had already returned the original product for a refund.  Since that item was no longer in stock, the vendor offered to send another Aviator watch I had considered, the Special Ops Diver.  That item has been shipped and I'm quite eager to receive it and review it.  I have to say, that kind of fast, concerned and conscientious customer service goes a LONG way with me, in terms of keeping my business.  I'm now hoping that the originally ordered item, the F-Series Men's Vintage World II Pilot Design Quartz Chronograph, becomes available again, because I'm pretty certain I will reorder.  Well done!<br /><br />In contrast, below is the original review, if anyone is interested...my satisfaction level has definitely improved!<br /><br />Well...maybe it's just me, but I called customer support and they couldn't offer a solution.  Specifically, the 1/10th second hand would not reset to zero.  It got a little more off with the attempts at resetting it, so I finally ceased and desisted and decided to return the watch.  At this price point, one doesn't expect a whole lot, but simple functionality oughtn't to be too much to ask.  On the other hand, everything else was pretty much as advertised and expected.  A little odd that the second hand of the chronograph was a sub-dial and the regular second hand was the big sweep hand, as on a standard watch., but that's no big deal.  Some other time, maybe I'll reorder and see if I have better luck.",1,TRUE,2147,371,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0

I understand for good reason it's not recommended to put the poly case pieces on NATO or RAF type straps - Luckily, this isn't a typical strap -- It's a &#34;hard&#34; nylon, low-stretch strap for sure -- But the mount is a relatively stiff elastic - which was surprisingly easy to mount, even with no tools (although I have quite a decent selection of horological accompaniments).  AND HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED -- Was working while a reasonably heavy piece of wood came down against my arm, hitting my watch.  (A) Would've hurt a lot and (B) would've easily destroyed the watch (even if it was steel, I'm sure there would've been damage).  But with the pins going through those elastic mounts, one of them gave its life to save the watch.  Actually found the pin - basically a 90-degree &#34;L&#34; on the ground.  No damage to the strap, no damage to the watch.  Other pin held fine so no watch on the ground (one of the big advantages to NATO/RAF-type straps in the first place).

I’ve paid much more for Eunina jeans and can honestly tell you they are a higher end boutique brand that’s good quality. These have little stretch to them. So I do suggest that you pay attention to the sellers size chart found up by the photos. For reference I’m 5’ tall, weigh 133ish and normally wear a size 4 or 7/27. Because girlfriend jeans are meant to fit loose for the most part, I sized down according to the size chart to a size 3. Which is generally my size for my preferred fit in mom jeans or girlfriend and they’re perfect. I did follow the size chart though. Just pay attention as the others listed by this seller are quite different. I’ll be ordering another pair in the future and by the chart shown I’ll order my regular size for the pair I have my eyes on. I chose to roll these twice and they hit just above my ankle. The waist hits just about at my belly button. While a straight fit throughout my legs, by sizing down I was able to achieve a fairly snug fit through my waist and bottom. Love the look of these, the wash is perfect with the distressing and the holes line up as they should. As with most of my overly distressed jeans I will wash on delicate cold cycle and hang dry. Putting them in the dryer once dry only to soften and relax them a bit.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend these. The seller shipped promptly and they arrived wrapped appropriately.

2,"So, number one, it's a nice heavy feeling bag, which makes it feel like leather and of high quality. BUT... I just couldn't get past two problems.<br /><br />The edges of everything-- all the black lines along the edges of pretty much every single part of the purse-- are sticky. Not just a little tacky, but actually sticky enough that when I put my hand into the purse to feel the bottom, it stuck to my sweatshirt and followed my wrist until I unstuck myself. I also noticed a distinct chemical smell-- probably if I cared to keep the purse, I could air it out on a windowsill for a few days-- just something to note.<br /><br />Also, and equally annoying with the stickiness... the belt around the purse. It actually has a function, not just decoration. The """"buckle"""" piece will slide (with great difficulty) along the belt, which tightens or loosens the amount of play all the way around the bag. This means that when you get the purse and open the box (nicely packaged by the way-- dust bag, tissue paper, even a roll of foam to keep the crease where the bag is folded in the box to a minimum).... you will see that the buckle is towards the side of the purse, not centered as it is in the photo. This keeps the belt taut around the bag and so it definitely restricts how wide open the top of the bag will open. SO, I thought, I'll just loosen up the belt a bit, I'll move the buckle to the center front and that will also allow me to open the bag """"mouth"""" and fit a wallet, checkbook, etc in there without having to slide my skin/clothing against the sticky Venus fly trap edges.  UGHH nooooooo, because moving the buckle is a major pain, and once you have the buckle centered, the belt sags horrifically, because I think I mentioned, this is actually fairly heavy material, so you will end up with the buckle facing the floor, hanging even with the bottom edge of the bag, and it just looks awful. And because the ends of the belt are stitched to the back of the purse, so it's not even a complete circle of belt all around, you can't adjust or play with it to center the buckle but keep the belt taut. All in all it's just a nice try to imitate the original designer's bag, but fail on execution.",7,TRUE,2207,415,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0

5,"(I actually bought the black bag, not the red as stated above).<br />I have only used this bag twice, but so far, I really, really like it!  OK...I  really, really love it!  It's three interior pockets are deep, which is an unexpected surprise.  I never would have thought of this feature as beneficial, but it is.  I can put my long credit card-holding wallet in the front pocket vertically, with plenty of room to spare.  I use the back pocket to hold my kindle or an agenda/calendar/logbook that fits it perfectly. The center pocket is perfect for my two sets of keys so I always know right where they are...no more endlessly searching for them, finally!  LOVE that. You can fit more stuff in if you are so inclined. Personally, I like the slim, stream-lined look.  It looks very slim from the side when empty, but once you put a few things in it fills out very nicely.<br />BEST OF ALL, this cross-body bag is absolutely adorable!  It's even better in person than as pictured.  What a find at this price!  I was torn as to what color to get...now I want more! LOL.  I'll be buying at least one more to give to my daughter for her birthday, in a different color, (which I will then be borrowing, a lot!)  I showed her the bag, and she was very impressed as well.  (She's 26, I'm coming up on 60, so this is a bag for all ages.)<br />I have to add that I have searched online and in-store at some of the major shopping malls and have found absolutely nothing that appeals to me at all like this one did.<br />One more thing to mention is that although some have expressed dismay that the two front zippered pockets are decorative only and not actual pockets; I think this bag was designed that way intentionally, because to fill those pockets would detract from the overall slim, streamlined look. I prefer it that way and if you get this bag, you' will see what I mean.  It's not a bag to carry everything you would normally stuff into a larger, wider bag, but more of an &#34;essentials-only&#34; type. (Will add photos soon.)<br />If any problems should arise, I will update this review, but for now, thumbs up and five stars!<br />UPDATE:  The lining inside behind the back pocket ripped out after around 3 months. :(  It's very thin material which isn't noticeable until after it rips.",4,FALSE,2292,415,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0

Also, if you have a very large chest, this probably would fit you, it might be a bit tight in the waist area, but it’ll definitely fit the girls.<br />Um... the back zipper is a nice feature?<br />Listen, they tried. If the dress were $12-15 dollars, I’d say give it a shot,  because maybe I just got a faulty one or something but at the price it is now, it doesn’t seem worth it.<br />For your reference, I am 5ft, 103lbs, 24 waist,30 B/C chest. The dress was 3 inches above my knee, about 4 inches bigger in my waist and the bust would have fit a 36-38 chest.<br />I purchased a small. I figured it would be a little bit too big based on the measurements provided in the listing and I could simply sew it smaller, but it’s already sewn so weirdly that I’d probably have to take the whole thing apart, recut it, then sew it back together!<br />Not worth it.<br />I returned the dress and paid the $6 to have it picked up and sent back to whence it came.🤷🏽‍♀️",0,TRUE,1932,361,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,0

1,"I can see how some folks may think this little &#34;wallet&#34; is cool, but those people obviously carry very small wallets and like to jump on &#34;coolness&#34; bandwagons.  It is a stretch to even call this a wallet.  There are many true wallets available that have the capability to attach it to your belt or to whatever you wish to attach.  After getting it I certainly don't consider it a wallet.  It is a leather and metal toy-wallet.  It is very much a &#34;minimalist&#34; wallet because it has only minimal usefulness.  I also thought it was cool ... until I got it and realized the coolness was destroyed by its impracticality.  It is WAY too small to be of practical value and much less efficient when you need to get to the stuff that could be more easily and practically carried in a normal trifold wallet.  After going through the hassle of breaking it in per the instructions via the warm water method and sorting through which plastic cards and items I would have to do without (because it can't realistically hold them all), I used it for a couple of days then gladly returned to my trifold.  One really BAD issue is that when you break the wallet in with a certain number of cards - let's say 8 - you will have difficulties if you then wish to carry less because they will not be tightly held within the wallet.  Even the instructions warn of this; therefore, anyone rebuking that fact is contradicting what the manufacturer themselves say!  You can possibly carry more cards than you broke it in with, but not less.  If you don't carry much in your wallet, want something cool and feel the need to brag about what is actually a stupid &#34;wallet&#34; concept, and are willing to endure a bit more effort to get to what is in your wallet, then go ahead and buy it.  But if you carry more than a few credit cards, want to be able to show or see you licenses without having to dig them out of the stack of plastic, and want to carry more than just a few items, this is NOT the wallet you should buy.  Instead, get a good trifold or tablet style wallet.  It is also way overpriced.  When and if Trayvax makes a true wallet I may reconsider and buy from them.",7,TRUE,2176,401,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0

The outside-facing side has a “wallet” with pockets for cash and 6 credit cards, a passport pocket, and a zippered phone pocket which fits my oversized iPhone 6+ in its large battery case. The outside also has loops to clip keys, radio, small light, etc.<br /><br />The materials and workmanship are excellent. This cost $10 more than some of the other holster-type rigs I looked at, but it’s worth it. The fabric is very sturdy, all of the edges are trimmed for durability, and the stitching is perfect. The rear buckle is sturdy plastic with a pivot for comfort, and the rear straps are like a lightweight small gauge auto seatbelt. This is not a toy, it’s more like good-quality outdoor equipment.<br /><br />I wear mine under my shirt.

3,"Bought the 6 wheeled version for my daughter in middle school to help lug her school stuff around due to a broken arm.  It has helped tremendously getting from class to class.  She has been using this for a month now but there are a few things to know....<br />What I like about it:<br />1. Holds (4) - 2” 3 ring binders, 4-5 thin folders, and 1-2 spiral notebooks.<br />2. The 6 wheeled version looks like a figet spinner (That is from my daughter.. lol).<br />3. Large side pockets on both sides of the backpack that fit her iPhone 5, lots of pens and pencils, and a 8oz. water bottle.<br />4. Large deep front pocket....she doesn’t use this one for school materials, only for her small makeup bag which is super light...(read dislikes).<br />5. Book bag material is good - seems sturdy.<br />What I don’t like about it:<br />1. The 6 wheeled version does not climb stairs that are of normal height (bus stairs or school stairways). It can only climb the height of a small curb or entrance to house i.e. very small ledge.  If it’s packed full it’s pretty heavy to pick up by the handle on the book bag!<br />2. If anything of moderate weight is filled up in the front pocket it will fall over face down on the floor.  Will not stand upright!<br />3. The separate rolling platform ....the underneath portion has the be continuously “snapped back into place”.  If the pieces have snapped loose the book bag will not sit upright and will fall face down.  I know that eventually this will break and I will need to rig this piece back together :( And she is not able to snap it back into place with her arm broken!<br />4. The telescopic metal handle has to be secured with screws and the ones supplied were the tiniest screws ever. She found this out on the 2nd day when the metal handle came unscrewed during her change of class in first period, so the rest of the day she had to have someone carry the book bag from the handle on the top of the book bag (not the metal handle) to every class!  Luckily, I am a DIY’er and found the solution to drill much larger screws into the handle. Problem Solved...handle hasn’t budged since!! Also, for obvious reasons carrying it from the metal handle will loosen the larger screws over time.<br />5. The platform should be designed better and weighted more in the front with better feet nobs...AGAIN... the book bag continues to fall face down if the contents inside are not properly organized with the heavier items near the back and the light items in the front.

The same stick on lens wouldn't conform.<br />4) other glasses - I tried them on other glasses, thinking it could just be an issue with these sunglasses...nope.  same problem.<br /><br />Ultimately, my guess is that I got a bad pair...which is unfortunate...but it also could say something about the quality of materials or the ahesive method itself (putting a drop of water between lenses, then drying the excess water).<br /><br />I suppose I'm back to hunting for bifocal sunglasses...which do exist, and are quite good...they just tend to have limited style options and a really good pair can cost you.",0,TRUE,1296,218,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0

Yes, there are nice features as described, such as an inset heel and raised arch, but this does little good if you can't keep your foot in the right position.  They are neither soft nor comfortable.  They are just extra thick rubber flip-flops... hardly worth the price.

Also, the sewn-in under layer is about three-quarter-length (mid-calve) and in my opinion is a bit too narrow (as in, you can't walk with a long stride in it, even though the skirt itself is full and would allow plenty of room if by itself).  In any bright light, it is clear that you have on a much-shorter length slip or underskirt underneath, and I just think that looks a little tacky under a long skirt that hits your ankles (but that may be a personal taste thing).<br /><br />While I took two stars entirely based on length and constriction issues with the underskirt, I personally plan to solve these issues by turning the item inside out and (very carefully) cutting the underskirt out of the skirt.  I will use my own full-length slip underneath instead.  I'm willing to modify it in this way because a full-length ivory skirt (that doesn't look such a way as to restrict it to formal evening events) is tough to find, but I understand not everyone will be willing to take a pair of scissors to the underskirt.  :-)",0,TRUE,1561,276,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0

It has a zippered pocket inside as well as two other non zippered pockets/holders. The back of the bag also has a pocket.<br /><br />The shoulder strap is adjustable and you can make it from a shoulder bag to almost crossbody length (depending on your size). I'm a plus size lady and I can wear it crossbody with the strap adjusted all the way out. I did have some trouble putting the strap on as the clips were really stiff and I felt like it was going to break.

Second, we received an item that was similar but not identical to the dress in the picture. The solid under-layer of this two-layer dress is cut differently from the photos.

This dress is a straight sheath dress, with a straight-line bust, from armpit to armpit, which isn't attractive.

On a fuller figured woman, it looks a bit cheap and unfinished, like they ran out of fabric. On a smaller-chested woman, it looks unflattering because it falls too low.

4,"BUREI Women’s 13002-LH Watch<br /><br />I should begin by saying that I received this product at a discount for a review. I agree with other reviewers as to the presentation of the watch. Once you get the package, you feel like you purchased a very fancy watch – which is true. The package comes with an elegant gift bag, the watch encased in a suede pillow, owner’s manual, warranty card, and a free gift (in my case, I got a fancy hair clamp). I rate them highly on presenting the watch in a very nice way. However, since we are not here to talk about the packaging, let me focus on the main attraction – the watch.<br /><br />The watch is beautiful – especially the rose-gold watches. I love watches, and this won my heart. It has a standard adjustment dial on the side of the watch to set the time. According to the manual, the watch is a 30M which means that it has some level of water-resistance to it, but that doesn’t mean that you would necessarily want to go scuba diving with it. I love the red and blue nylon strap; it looks like you can easily clean they should they begin to look dirty.<br /><br />If they could change one thing, I’d suggest they elongate the strap a bit. I have larger wrists, and this watch fit just OK, but it didn’t leave a little wiggle room to rotate freely around my cuff. Nonetheless, I will keep wearing this watch.<br /><br />All in all, this is a lovely, decent watch and ​has a lot of value in it. I recommend this piece to anyone, especially if you like what you see.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given a discount on this item in exchange for testing and giving my unbiased and honest review.

The backlight is ok, I personally don't think its as bad as people say. It allows you to read the time in the dark. The band has held up so far. Oh and it keeps excellent time.

Watch came with no instructions, for adjusting time or for removing links. Adjusting time isn't a problem, but how to remove the links isn't exactly common knowledge. I found out that it doesn't matter which side you push the pins out of because the pins are the same both sides. Further more, you need the right size pin to pound the pins out of the links, and you having to be careful with the hammer so as not to break the wood, as my husband did. We glued the broken piece back on.<br />I feel that the seller should include a small pin (the cost would be minimal) as well as good instructions on how to remove the extra links. I just happened to find a small pin in my junk drawer that happened to do the job, but somebody else might not be so lucky. My teen son was originally very interested in the watch, but the frustration of not knowing how to remove the links made him lose interest in the watch altogether.

But it's too long by at least 6 or 8 inches, so it would need altered which is too much extra cost for a dress of this quality. The dresses are very pretty from a distance.

3,"**Update: 6/2/22**<br /><br />So, it appears my enthusiasm for these lower cost winders was a bit premature and I have reduced my rating to three stars. While this unit still adequately functions for my needs, the individual turntable rotational speed tends to be inconsistent if only one heavier weight watch is mounted on a turntable. The  turntable gives the appearance of being out of balance and struggles to complete a rotation. I placed a diver style watch weighing around 160 g on the left turntable and it immediately looked like it was trying to drag a boulder up a hill. Once I placed another similarly weighted watch in the second slot, it was fine but the fact it has to be balanced is a concern as there will be instances where I actually wear one of the watches...<br /><br />**End of update.**<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />As a watch enthusiast and also a vine program participant with an embarrassing lack of impulse control, I've added a number of low end automatic watches to my collection, to the point the number of automatics in my possession far exceeded available slots on the watch winders I owned. In the main, most of these angled carousel winders had too many deficiencies to meet my requirements, let alone meet the TPD specifications of some higher tier watch makers. Notwithstanding those considerations, the Flint 4 slot winders may well be as good as one is likely to find with more economical units.<br /><br />I consider the Flint 4 slot winders to be of quality construction and above average performance for the price point. While it has a few deficiencies often found with these lower end winders, based on my experience with them (I liked the first one enough to acquire a second four slotter) thus far I don't think many competitive 4 slot units in the sub $200 range are going to equal or surpass it, either in terms of build quality, versatility of mode options, quiet operation or durability. According promotional information, it is driven by two Mabuchi motors, a widely respected driving source found in a healthy proportion of lower to mid-priced watch winders. As is common with that motor, this device is commendably quiet and smooth in operation. I have the same motor in a couple of other winders and it has proven highly dependable, accepting I don't have any of them operating 24/7.<br /><br />It also features a choice of power options, either AC power or battery. For the latter it requires two """"D"""" cell batteries, which in my case powered the two Mabuchi motor driven turnstiles for approximately two weeks when set to rotational mode '4.' While not specifically stated with any of the documentation, I do not believe the batteries should be left in place when the winder is on AC power as with other units I have from other distributors/manufacturers it is noted the winder could be damaged by doing so.<br /><br />The medium density fiberboard constructed box is covered with a black and gray houndstooth patterned shiny finish  polymer sheet covering and features of acrylic glass display forward opening top. As noted above it is appreciably quiet in operation and there is a convenient auto stop mechanism when the top is opened. The watch box is lockable and the package includes a skeleton styled key. The back of the winder houses the battery compartment as well as independent activation switches for each of the two watch turntables. The winder also has a unit power switch and another for the background lighting.<br /><br />The more or less horizontal orientation of the memory foam pillow cushion slots on this model facilitates accommodation of larger cased watches side by side on one turnstile without the cases or crowns of one watch potentially damaging the other. I have included a photo of two larger case models mounted side by side (the displayed watches on left turntable are not automatic but only mounted for demonstration purposes - I don't own any automatics of that immense -around 48mm each - size.) NONE of these lower price watch winder sellers seem to comprehend cycle time isn't the only specification for automatics and many users need more options to determine the optimal settings for their watches. However, grading on the curve this one impresses me as a much better than most at this price point.",1,FALSE,4303,730,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0

I’m 5’’4 217lbs & bra size 38DDD top and mid section heavy and purchased a XL. I purchased very last minute for an adult prom function and decided to take a chance on it mainly because it was Prime lol but also can’t go wrong with a wrap around dress. Once you figure out how to tie it, depending on how much leg slit & cleavage you’re comfortable with, it fits nicely and perfect. I had on a black spanx suit I guess you call it, has shorts and exposes the breast area, so I wore a nicely fitted black bra, also purchased on Amazon. I say this to say that the shimmer is very nice but in lighting it might be see through a little (not too sure cause I had black spanx). The ONLY flaws for me were one it had a tear near the seam by the side, under the sleeve to which I had no choice but to sew myself because again I had no time to return it and I really liked how it fit. Secondly- I personally wished it was longer…I had stilettos on and it touched my ankle strap. I only wished it was longer given the event.

The lace was somewhat fragile and stretchy while the polyester body wasn't the highest quality, but since it was being worn at night and in low light I wasn't too concerned. My main concern was that the dress ran small. I am about 5'2&#34; and 118 lb. and ordered the size medium based on the size chart. The dress has one zipper in the back, running from the neckline toward the floor. However it only unzips 8&#34;, making it very difficult to put on. I could not pull the dress over my hips but rather had to pull it very carefully over my head - putting stress on the lace sleeves, primarily the armpit areas where lace seams meet. Ideally I would have stood with my arms straight in the air and it drop down on me. I actually had to mend a portion of the armhole where the lace stretched from the difficulty of  putting it on.<br /><br />That being said, once it was on, it was a very classic, conservative and elegant dress that I felt good and pretty wearing.

4,"[[VIDEOID:330c165cc63aff99cdcd9d81d6082b6]] I got these for my 4.5 year old daughter who recently started swim lessons. These are great, I really like them especially way more than the cheap goggles I had bought her at first. The nose bridge is adjustable by snapping in one of three different length little plastic peices, as opposed to other goggles that end up leaving something awkward in between your eyes if you try to shorten it. It was a little difficult for me to get the piece out so I could snap the smaller one in, but I think other than the couple of seconds of frustration, it's a good thing knowing it's not just going to pop out while swimming. The silicone around the eyes and the head strap really are soft.  it's not that sticky kind that pulls hair trying to get it off wich is a plus for little girls with long hair. True to the description these goggles never fogged up or let any water in, which is impressive since the last pair she used she had to keep lliftting them up to let water out. As a mom I'm also very happy about the UV protection, and having a case to keep them in so the lenses don't get scratched up in her swim bag is pretty cool. The case even has air holes so you don't have to worry about mildew and what not if you put them away with a little moisture still on them.  The only problem I had was the marks around her eyes after her 30 minute classes.

So I'm very critical and demanding about how comfortable they are primarily, second how they look, obviously and finally the quality of the stitching and the denim composition. I discovered Joe's Jeans and they instantly became my overwhelming favorite despite an eye watering price, at least in my opinion. I bought multiple pairs of one model of dark blue to assure having them for years to come. These Genuine Assembly Skinny fit jeans arrived and I was immediately struck by the weight of the package. they had heft that might indicate a substantial jean. They have """"skinny"""" right in the name so I was prepared to snake into them and pronounce them uncomfortable like compression socks. But I didn't. Though the lower legs are slimmer, I'm not sure I'd call them skinny at all. Maybe slim fit is more accurate. Surprisingly, as other reviewers noted as well. the waist area, even though they are my standard 32 inch waist, were actually a little loose. No wearing these without a belt. But once belted the fit is almost perfect for my form. I love the fact that the pockets don't have some obnoxious stitching that screams No Style Taste, though even expensive jeans can go off the deep end with cheapening details and over design. These have clean lines and an efficient cut and look. The stitching is even and secure. Areas are faded, but in a way that makes it look the most convincing of any pair of jeans I've owned that makes it appear this was caused by genuine wear and washing and not some contrived exaggerated design or acid torture process.  Like many jeans today, the length is a standard 34 inches. I wear 32 length, but the extra length allows you to roll them into a cuff if you like. I coincidentally just bought a pair of sueded Chelsea boots, and these jeans were made to be paired with them, including the extra length. I was asked to review these jeans as a preproduction model so no price was listed on the amazon page. My Joe's Jeans retail for almost $200, so if these are anything under $150, I'd say they are a good value since they should last many years of wear, the material is comfortable with just enough stretch, and the fit, while not exactly skinny as advertised, to me is a more user friendly and comfortable """"slim"""". Highly recommended! These are more casual and less dressy, serious looking than my deep blue Joe's, but they will get nearly the same workout in my wear rotation.",0,FALSE,2489,443,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0

The quality is so good that I cannot give it a poor rating of one or two stars.  But the problems are significant enough that I cannot give it more than 3 stars.<br /><br />The actual fit is true to size.  I am a size 2x and the XXL fits me perfectly.  This surprised me because most of the reviews stated that it runs big and so I expected a looser fit.  The length is perfect on my body - I am tall and it hits me at the low-hip, covering up my butt very nicely.  But I wonder what will happen when it is washed - if it shrinks a bit, this will not be appropriate for me because it'll be too small.  As it is, I can wear this without a problem, but it doesn't have that roomy feel that I was after and if it shrinks in the wash, not sure it'll fit anymore.  Not what I expected, and if I wash it, I might not be able to return it.<br /><br />The thing I do not like is that the material is super-dense and thick and the design is unforgiving, extremely structured and not at all relaxed.  There is very little stretch and it has a mind of its own, making me fight for every movement that I make.  It is not too small - but simply too overbearing.  The result is that instead of me wearing this shirt, THIS SHIRT IS WEARING ME!!!  😳  People should never have to conform to their clothes.  Clothes should ALWAYS CONFORM TO THE PERSON.  This doesn't conform to me.<br /><br />When I put on activewear that is intended for fun and games or sports, I don't want a prim and proper silhouette.  I want a relaxed feel that gives me freedom of movement.  This shirt is really the opposite of what I expect in a sweatshirt.  I believe that casual garments should be comfortable and relaxed - not stiff and confining.  They should conform to the body of the wearer and not make you fight for each movement you make.<br /><br />It is possible that after washing, it will soften up and be a little bit easier to wear, but after I wash it, I'm not sure that it will still be returnable if it doesn’t get better.  So I'm a bit undecided whether to keep it or not.  In a lot of ways, it is a great piece of clothing, but the fatal flaws make me suspect that if I end up keeping it, then eventually it will end up at the thrift store.  So I'll probably return it and keep looking for exactly the right thing.  It is so close to my ideal sweatshirt that I'll probably go ahead and wash it in hopes of it getting soft and pliable.

Well assembled and stitched with attention to detail, no dangling threads needing to be cleaned up. The embroidery work is expertly done and logo presented in the exact understated eye catching fashion that initially aroused my curiosity. The mesh is unique ,and I believe, probably fabricated in house, from the same fine, soft cotton material used in the rest of the hat. It is both comfortable and functional and allows for a clean and smooth transition at the junction of the solid and perforated cloth materials. This is often not a priority from many manufacturers of mesh back ball caps.  It has a true and consistent olive drab pigment through out and all existing thread used for assembly matches or compliments its fine textile admirably. This is a low to midrise profile, structured crown, mesh back hat with quality hook and loop closure construction ( which is an absolute must for me -""""NO SNAPBACKS """") which is my style of choice to suite the larger than average head size which I was dealt.

I've only used it for one weekend, so I can't comment on long term durability, but these are my observations so far...<br /><br />This bag is just a little wider side-to-side and a little narrower front-to-back than an Adidas gym bag that I had been using as a weekend travel bag (overall cubic inches comes out about the same). The big difference (other than appearance) is that the KAKA bag has more pockets than most bags this size. The item description and images here provide a good overview of the pockets, so I won't bother to repeat it. I will simply say that this bag kept my things much more organized and accessible than they've been in the past.<br /><br />Zippers on the bag are all metal. The front pocket looks like a buckle closure, but that's mostly for appearance, and it actually closes with magnets. The stitching throughout the bag looks good, if not necessarily heavy-duty.<br /><br />As for overall appearance, some people will like it; some will not. My girlfriend says it's ugly. I said it looks like something Theodore Roosevelt might have used (I have the khaki version). I will say that the bag is a little more &#34;frumpy&#34; than what the pictures here show.

5,"I have bought many tapers and plugs through out the years. These are very handy to have trust me! Over the years I've spent a ton of money on individual tapers and to only go through different sizes through the years. These are perfect because you have every size needed except for anything over 00g. I have not needed the rest of them but I figured it would be nice to have a whole set in case I ever wanted to go smaller. Right now I am at 00g but often times I fluctuate lower just to try new things.<br /><br />These do not come marked at all, nothing on the bag and no paperwork. If you have experience with gauges then you already know what size each are just by looking at them. A quick helpful hint is the lowest is the smallest which is 14g then just eye which ones is slight bigger and go up to 12g and so on. The highest number in this kit is 00g which means that will be the biggest size. You should be able to figure out which is which now. If anyone has any trouble figuring out sizes, you can always check online too.<br /><br />Some of the others I have bought in the past have plugs with sharp edges not something you want on your ears. You will be quick to learn why! These are fancy like the other ones but they are still equally nice. The black plugs and tapers are shiny and easy to clean. The best part about this kit is it is the perfect start out one for anyone wanting to gauge their ears. You can start out small and grow higher in size. The packaging of these is incredible each plug and taper comes in their own bag and both are put into another bag for safe keeping. These are all in order from size and accordingly. You get 36 pieces - 4 of each size with 8 different sizes. They also have a stainless steel set which I have not tried yet. I personally always go for the standard dark set because they pair well with everything.<br /><br />Compared to most kits this is a really great deal. One standard plug can run you anywhere from $15-$60 depending on how intricate the details run on them. Plus, handmade ones tend to run a little more on the pricey side. With this one you get 36 pieces for under $20.

Unlike most cheaper necklaces, there is a loop built into the shape of the pendant to attach to the small connector ring which holds it into the chain (look closely at the image).

Parts of the metal at the corners weren't knocked out properly. I fixed that myself with my pocketknife, not a big deal. While on the bronze pendant, the circle (stone) was attached minimally at both sides to the triangle (below the surface of the pendant on both sides), on the silver necklace, it is completely unattached on one side, and overly attached to the point of being visible on the other side. Finally, in the middle of the triangle, the wand is slightly thin at one point; it is not the same on the bronze pendant nor is it accurate. Very odd, but not so glaringly bad as to return it; unless someone gets about two feet away from my chest, they won't notice.<br /><br />Again, these are both beautiful, and I intend to keep them both, but it seems as if the silver one was made with a different process than the bronze one, and it didn't come out as well.<br /><br />Overall, very happy.

I hope to be able to wear every day but not sure if I can tolerate long term but they provide the perfect support during this flare up.

My nipples could clearly be seen through both the underwire bra and fabric, and that was at room temperature, if that tells you anything.  The back is very low, and kept on flipping over to show the shelf bra part in the short time that I had it on in my house.  It's not practical if you are planning to be at all active in it.  Also, their sizing chart tells you to order a size up from your normal to start, but I wouldn't suggest it!  I'm normally a size 14, so I ordered a 16, and it was big on me, so stick to your size.  I'm sending this back tomorrow because it's really not worth the amount you pay for it!  I have better tankini's from cheap department stores.<br />I did like the draped feeling in the front though.
